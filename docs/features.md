Movigo aims to offer an easy-to-use, modern, modular and extremely light tool for creating DOM animations using CSS keyframes in a more dynamic and flexible context with JavaScript.

Although still in the preliminary stage, there are already JavaScript Web Animation APIs integrated in the latest versions of browsers. Movigo wants to be a similar tool, but already usable and designed to offer a simpler and more familiar syntax.

The library weighs about 3 KB, uses Promises and the so-called Method Chaining technique in a similar way to JQuery. It also takes advantage of JavaScript closures to maintain a specific parameter state of the animations for each function chain. These concepts will be explored in the description of the components that follows, with detailed examples of the code.
